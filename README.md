> Eliminate multidimensional poverty.

The Poverty Stoplight survey was created as both a metric and a methodology to enable families to assess their levels of multidimensional poverty.

Using an app on a phone, tablet or computer, families take a visual survey to self-evaluate their level of poverty, visualize their results on a dashboard, and create a lifemap that helps them target their situation to overcome poverty. Families select images, categorized as red, yellow or green, that resemble their reality for each poverty indicator. Through its geo-tagging capabilities, the app then identifies the familyâ€™s location for entire communities, allowing stakeholders to make targeted efforts and to better channel resources in a joint effort to eliminate poverty.
